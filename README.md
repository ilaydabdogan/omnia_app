# Omnia World AI

Omnia is a spiritually intelligent self-discovery platform. It's a place for modern souls to understand themselves better—through poetic tools called Omnis.

## About

Each Omni is a self-reflection experience powered by emotional AI and a symbolic equation:

**Ax + B = y + Cz**

Where:
- A = Current state
- B = Past patterns
- x = Input ritual
- y = Personalized reflection
- Cz = Social resonance

Omnia is not a content app—it is a mirror. It's not for productivity. It's for personal clarity, meaning, and truth.

## Screenshots

The app showcases a modern, poetic UI with various sections:
- Explore Page with horizontal scrolling Omni cards
- Categorized Omni experiences (Fun & Weird, Self Discovery, etc.)
- Featured Journeys for multi-part experiences
- Suit filtering (Mind, Life, Heart, Self, Wildcard)
